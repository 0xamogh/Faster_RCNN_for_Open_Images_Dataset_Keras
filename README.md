# Faster R-CNN for Open Images Dataset by Keras
## Introduction
The original code of Keras version I used here is written by [yhenon](https://github.com/yhenon). This is the [github link](https://github.com/yhenon/keras-frcnn). He used the PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012, and MS COCO datasets. For me, I just extracted three classes which are "Person", "Car" and "Mobile phone" from Google's Open Images Dataset V4. I edited configures, remove some parts I didn't need and wrote some comments upon his work. Btw, in order to run this on **Google Colab** (for free GPU computing up to 12hrs), I compressed all the code in oneÂ .ipynb notebook. Sorry about the messy structure.

I wrote my exploring and understanding of Faster R-CNN in this [article]() in Medium. If you are in China, you cannot access [Medium](https://medium.com). So I make a copy in [here]().
